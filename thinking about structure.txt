I want like topics I guess. Subjects? Items? Issues?

An issue has something like data points

I can pool the data points from various issues together and compare them... in some kind of table?

data points will have things in common and it should be easy to plot those things along a common axis
	I guess these "points" should be able to implement common traits or something

so for example mood could be an enumerated type..?? i want a mood series or something? So a mood is a type of series?

How about a series is a compound type of an entry

entry is an abstract class that a class can extend

MoodEntry extends Entry

entry has a timestamp

series has a list of entries

series can be sorted by entry timestamps
