The goal behind this project is to learn new things about Java and SpringBoot. I'd like for it to be a public project on my github, but I'd also like to have private medical and other information in the database. As a result, this will be a great place to practice keeping data and credentials out of my version control, something I've so far not had to do.   
  
### What The Project Is
This is a basic full-stack web application. The business of the app is to allow me a convenient place to store, view, and analyze data relating to my day-to-day life. Things like my diet, mood, sleep, et cetera. Ideally that will help me in some way with making empirical decisions regarding the impact of these variables on one another. 

#### The Tech
The main portion of this project, and the one that I will work on first, is the backend written in SpringBoot (Java). I think I will use Vue (TypeScript, ideally) for the frontend, that's what they use at my new job, and I'll work out what they use for internal databases and decide if I should use that or go with something else like MySQL, PostGreSQL, SQLite. SQLite would be totally fine, but then this entire application could totally just be a Google Sheet. It's about the journey, maaaaan. Whatever I use for databases will probably be SQL since I'm quite sure they use something SQL-based at work. 

#### Organization, Flow, Planning, SYNERGY, Doubling-Back, AGILE, BUZZWORDS
It would make sense to first plan ans second execute here. I normally do the opposite and that leads to sticking points. Practice setting out a good plan will be beneficial. Ideally I think I'd like to make a UML document that explains things. It's trick to work with but I think I'm close to getting the hang of it. I think I will start with an MSPaint drawing though, since that's faster and I don't have a lot of time tonight.

I will need to document both data / information flow as well as project structure, since I want to make sure I work well around git without accidentally pushing something that should be confidential.
